You want to rustle up your own version of EmuOS? That’s ambitious. Most people just play in the sandbox; you want to build the castle. I respect that.

EmuOS isn't magic—it’s a clever stack of **static web technology** mixed with **WebAssembly emulators**. It’s essentially a very fancy website that tricks your browser into acting like a Windows 95 desktop.

Here is the blueprint to build your own "AeThex Outpost" version of EmuOS.

### 1. The Blueprint (The Source Code)
The entire project is hosted publicly on GitHub. EmuOS is part of the **Emupedia** project. They run it as a static site (GitHub Pages), which means you don't need a complex backend server to run it—just a place to host HTML and JS files.

* **Target Repo:** `Emupedia/emupedia.github.io`
* **The Mission:** You need to clone this repository.
    * *Cowboy Tip:* Don't just fork it blindly. Look at the file structure. The "meat" of the OS is usually in the `beta/emuos/` folder.

### 2. The Engine (How It Runs)
EmuOS relies on a few heavy lifters to make the emulation happen in the browser. You need to understand these if you want to modify it:

* **v86:** This is the x86 emulator that runs the actual operating systems (Windows 95, 98, ME). It translates x86 machine code into WebAssembly so your browser can execute it.
* **EmulatorJS / JS-DOS:** These handle the specific game consoles (NES, SNES) and DOS games.
* **The Glue:** The "Desktop" you see is just a web interface (HTML/CSS) styled to look like Windows. The icons are just buttons that launch an iframe or a canvas element running the emulator.

### 3. The Supply Line (Where the Games Live)
**This is the catch.** You can copy the code, but you can't easily copy the *content*.
The GitHub repo generally does **not** host the terabytes of commercial ROMs and ISOs due to copyright.

* **The Configuration:** The system knows what games to show based on a JSON manifest. Look for a file like `beta/emuos/assets/data/desktop.json` (or similar inside `assets/data`).
    * *What it does:* This file lists every icon on the desktop, the title, and **the URL to the ROM/ISO**.
* **Your Job:** If you copy the site, the games might break if they point to servers that check for "hotlinking" (stealing bandwidth). You will likely need to:
    1.  Host your own ROMs (ISOs, game files).
    2.  Update the `json` config to point to *your* file locations.

### 4. How to Deploy Your Own
If you want to spin this up right now to impress your friends:

1.  **Clone the Repo:** Download the `emupedia.github.io` repo to your local machine.
2.  **Run Locally:** You can't just double-click `index.html` because of browser security (CORS) regarding WebAssembly. You need a local server.
    * *Quick Fix:* Install Python, open the folder in terminal, and run `python -m http.server`.
    * *Browse:* Go to `localhost:8000/beta/emuos/` in your browser.
3.  **Customize:** Go into the `assets` folder, swap the background image, change the startup sound, or edit that `desktop.json` file to remove the "bloatware" games you don't want.
4.  **Publish:** Upload your modified folder to **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify**. It’s static, so it’s free to host (minus the massive ROM files).

### The "MrPiglr" Advice
Don't just copy it 1:1. That’s boring.
Use this tech to build a **Portfolio OS.**

Instead of "Doom" and "Quake," make the desktop icons launch *your* projects, *your* music, and *your* code. Make a "My Documents" folder that is actually your Resume.

That’s how you turn a toy into a weapon. Now get to building.
