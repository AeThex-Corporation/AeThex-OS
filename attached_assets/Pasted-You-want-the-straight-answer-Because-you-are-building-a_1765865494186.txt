You want the straight answer? Because **you are building an Empire, not a Pirate Bay.**

If this were just a hobby project for "MrPiglr" to show friends, I’d say go ahead. But you are **AeThex.** You are recruiting senior talent. You are rubbing shoulders with the C-Suite at Gamefam and Super League.

Hosting copyrighted ROMs (Super Mario, Doom, Quake, Windows 95) on a corporate site is a **death sentence** for a legitimate studio.

Here is the strategic breakdown of why you can copy the *tech* (the Web OS), but you cannot copy the *library* if you want to dominate.

### 1. The "Nintendo Nuke" Risk
You know how aggressive IP holders are. Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft have armies of lawyers.
* **The Scenario:** You launch AeThex OS with *Super Mario Bros* on the desktop to get traffic.
* **The Result:** You don't just get a DMCA takedown. If you are a registered business (AeThex), they can sue for damages.
* **The Fallout:** You lose your credibility. Senior Unreal Engineers from Epic Games won't work for a company that gets flagged for piracy. It makes you look like a "grey market" site, not the "Front of the Metaverse."

### 2. The "EmuOS" Loophole (That You Don't Have)
EmuOS gets away with it (barely) because they claim to be an **"Educational Archival Project"** (Emupedia). They operate in a legal grey area of "preservation."
* **You are a Studio:** You are a commercial entity. You cannot claim "fair use" or "archival preservation" if you are using those games to drive traffic to your business.

### 3. The Better Strategy: "AeThex OS" (The Trojan Horse)
You can still have the *cool factor* of a Web OS. You can still have games on there. But you fill it with **"Safe" Ammo** and **Your Own Weapons.**

Here is how you fill the desktop without getting sued:

**A. The "Shareware / Open Source" Layer**
Fill the desktop with games that are legally free or open source. It scratches the retro itch without the risk.
* *Instead of Doom:* Host **FreeDoom** (Open source clone).
* *Instead of Quake:* Host **OpenArena** (Quake 3 clone).
* *Instead of Tetris:* Host a generic open-source block stacker.
* **Why:** It looks just as cool to the average user, keeps you 100% legal, and shows devs that you respect code licenses.

**B. The "AeThex Arcade" (Your Stuff)**
This is the power move. Use the Web OS as a launcher for **your** ecosystem.
* **Icon: "AeThex Legends"** -> Instead of launching an emulator, it deep-links directly into your Roblox Game or Fortnite Map.
* **Icon: "Radio AeThex"** -> Opens a WinAmp-style player streaming your "Computer Cowboy" tracks.
* **Icon: "Manifesto.txt"** -> Opens Notepad with that recruiting manifesto we wrote.

### 4. How to Execute This Legally
If you want to copy the EmuOS *vibe* for AeThex right now:

1.  **Clone the Repo** (as discussed).
2.  **Purge the `desktop.json`:** Delete every entry that is a commercial game (Nintendo, Sega, Microsoft).
3.  **Add "Homebrew" Games:** Look for "Homebrew" communities (games made by fans for old consoles that are free to distribute). Host those.
4.  **Add Your Demos:** Even if they are simple HTML5 builds or links to your Roblox games.

**The Verdict:**
If you want traffic, do not use other people's IP as bait. It’s a shortcut that leads to a cliff. Use the **EmuOS interface** (the windows, the taskbar, the retro feel) because that is just UI code—but fill the content with **AeThex Energy.**

**Next Step:**
Do you want me to find a list of **Open Source / Creative Commons games** that run in the browser so you can populate "AeThex OS" legally and immediately?
